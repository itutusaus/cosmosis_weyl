# cosmosis_weyl

In this repository we provide the modified CosmoSIS files for the measurement of the Weyl potential evolution presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06434

The repository contains 2 folder:
- cosmosis_modules
- des-y3-maglim-ini-files

## cosmosis_modules

We provide in this subdirectory the CosmoSIS modules to consider the bhat and Jhat parameters, as well as the effective power spectra for galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We further provide the modified module to project from three-dimensional power spectra to angular power spectra. Please, if you use any of these files consider citing the original references from https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## des-y3-maglim-ini-files

We provide the ini files for the baseline run in https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06434. This includes the priors, scale cuts, and the modified CosmoSIS pipeline. Please, if you use any of these files consider citing the original references from https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
